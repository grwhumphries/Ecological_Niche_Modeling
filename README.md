Ecological_Niche_Modeling
=========================

R GUI for Ecological Niche Modeling 

The goal of this code will be to create an R GUI that will allow users to perform Ecological Niche Modeling
without the programmatic interface. This will include options to allow users to perform all the basic modeling steps
wherein the only requirements will be a pre-created presence/absence shape file of species occurrences and a suite of 
environmental variables, all in the same geographic projection.
